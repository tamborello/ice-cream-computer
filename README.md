This is a learning exercise to teach myself how to make a web application including some machine learning and how to use an external database. Algorithms like naive Bayesian classifiers (a version of which is used here) form the basis of knowledge tools like modern spam filtering.
See http://icecreamcomputer.com/ for a working example.
